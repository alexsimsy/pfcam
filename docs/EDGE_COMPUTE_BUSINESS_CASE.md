## Cloudflare HTTPS Integration

For production edge deployments, we recommend using Cloudflare for DNS and HTTPS termination:

- **Free Universal SSL:** Cloudflare provides free SSL/TLS certificates for all proxied domains.
- **End-to-End Encryption:** Use 'Full (Strict)' SSL mode with Cloudflare Origin Certificates for secure traffic from browser to Cloudflare and Cloudflare to your server.
- **No Certificate Renewal Hassle:** Cloudflare Origin Certificates do not expire for 15 years and do not require Let's Encrypt or manual renewal.
- **Simple Setup:** Generate and install an Origin Certificate from the Cloudflare dashboard, update your Nginx config, and you're done.
- **Automatic HTTPS Redirects:** Cloudflare can force all traffic to HTTPS and rewrite insecure links.

This approach is highly recommended for scalable, secure, and low-maintenance edge deployments.
