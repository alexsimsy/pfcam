#### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI with async support
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with async SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based permissions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Logging**: Structured logging with structlog

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables with relationships
users (id, email, username, role, permissions)
cameras (id, name, ip_address, status, settings)
events (id, camera_id, filename, metadata, files, video_extension, is_played)
tags (id, name, color, description)
event_tags (event_id, tag_id) -- Many-to-many relationship
camera_settings (id, camera_id, settings_data, version)
```

#### API Structure
```
/api/v1/
├── auth/          # Authentication endpoints
├── users/         # User management
├── cameras/       # Camera management
├── events/        # Event management
├── tags/          # Tag management
├── settings/      # Camera settings
└── streams/       # Video streams
```
